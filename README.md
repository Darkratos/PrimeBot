# PrimeBot

This is a short project for a discord bot capable of scraping Amazon Prime's page and  
sending all new content to a specific channel.  
  
It looks for new content when the bot is started, but it's easily modifiable to search in a  
set interval of time.  
  
It needs Selenium and Discord's libraries to run, and a discord bot token (see in the documentation).  
  
I also included a sample for games and dlcs, as well as the current version of the geckodriver (for firefox).  
I advise updating the driver regularly, and commenting the send part to generate the files for the first time.
