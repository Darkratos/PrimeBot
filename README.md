# PrimeBot

This is a short project for a discord bot capable of scraping Amazon Prime's page and  
sending all new content to a specific channel.  
  
It looks for new content when the bot is started, but it's easily modifiable to search in a  
set interval of time.  
  
It needs Selenium and Discord's libraries to run, and a discord bot token (see in the documentation).
